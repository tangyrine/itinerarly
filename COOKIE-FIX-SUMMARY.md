# üç™ OAuth Cookie Fix - Implementation Summary

## üîç Problem Identified
A critical authentication issue was identified in the OAuth flow where an invalid character (ASCII 34/double quote) in cookie values was causing authentication failures.

## ‚úÖ Fix Implementation
The following changes were implemented to fix the issue:

### 1. Cookie Sanitization Utility
Created a new utility file `lib/cookie-utils.ts` with functions to:
- Sanitize cookie values by removing problematic characters (double quotes, semicolons, commas, backslashes)
- Safely set cookies with sanitized values
- Safely get cookie values

### 2. Updated AuthenticationTester Component
- Refactored `components/AuthenticationTester.tsx` to use the new cookie utility functions
- Ensured all cookie values are properly sanitized before being set
- Replaced all direct `Cookies.set()` calls with `setCookieSafely()` calls

### 3. Added Validation
- Created a test script `test-cookie-sanitization.sh` to validate the cookie sanitization
- Ensures proper handling of problematic cookie characters
- Simulates the OAuth flow with problematic cookie values

## üß™ Testing
The fix was verified using:
1. Manual testing of the OAuth flow
2. Automated cookie sanitization tests
3. Simulation of problematic cookie values

## üìù Implementation Details

### Cookie Value Sanitization
```typescript
export function sanitizeCookieValue(value: string | undefined): string {
  if (!value) return '';
  
  return value
    .replace(/"/g, '')  // Remove double quotes
    .replace(/;/g, '')  // Remove semicolons
    .replace(/,/g, '')  // Remove commas
    .replace(/\\/g, '') // Remove backslashes
    .trim();            // Remove whitespace
}
```

### Safe Cookie Setting
```typescript
export function setCookieSafely(
  Cookies: any,
  name: string, 
  value: string | undefined,
  options?: any
): void {
  if (!Cookies || !name) return;
  
  const sanitizedValue = sanitizeCookieValue(value);
  Cookies.set(name, sanitizedValue, options);
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations
- HttpOnly cookies are still properly handled by the browser and not accessible via JavaScript
- The sanitization does not affect the security of HttpOnly cookies set by the backend
- No changes were needed to the backend configuration

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. Apply the same cookie sanitization in other components if needed
2. Consider adding more comprehensive cookie validation
3. Continue monitoring for any additional authentication issues
