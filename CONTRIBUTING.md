- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Links to related issues

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types for components and functions
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the naming convention: PascalCase for components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

### File Structure
- Components go in the `components/` directory
- Utilities go in the `lib/` directory
- Types go in the `types/` directory
- Tests go in the `__tests__/` directory

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Follow the existing design patterns
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes

## Data Contributions

### Adding Tourist Destinations
To add new destinations to the database (`data/sections.js`):

1. Follow the existing data structure
2. Ensure accurate location information
3. Include relevant categories (Hill Station, Historical, Beach, Wildlife)
4. Verify data quality and accuracy

### Geographic Data
When updating map data (`app/start/india-geoJson.json`):
- Maintain GeoJSON format standards
- Ensure coordinate accuracy
- Test map rendering after changes

## Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Browser and device information
- Screenshots or error messages

## Feature Requests

For feature requests:
- Check existing issues first
- Provide clear use case and benefits
- Include mockups or examples if applicable
- Discuss implementation approach

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API rate limiting**: If encountering rate limiting with the Gemini API:
- The application automatically retries with exponential backoff
- Check your API quota in the Google AI Studio
- Consider implementing a caching strategy for common requests

**Build errors**:
- Ensure Node.js version is 18.17.0 or higher
- Clear the `.next` cache directory and rebuild

**Map rendering issues**:
- Check console for any CORS errors
- Ensure GeoJSON data is properly formatted

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help others learn and grow
- Provide constructive feedback
- Follow the project's code of conduct

## Special Thanks
