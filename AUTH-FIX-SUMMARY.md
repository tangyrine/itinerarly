# Cross-Domain Cookie Authentication Fix

## Problem Description
The frontend application was experiencing issues with JWT tokens appearing as null despite the backend generating them correctly. This was due to the cookies being set as HttpOnly for security, which prevents JavaScript from directly accessing them.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TokenProvider
- Modified to stop relying on direct cookie access for JWT tokens
- Added an `isAuthenticated` state to track authentication status
- Improved authentication checks using API calls instead of cookie checks
- Added debugging hooks

### 2. Enhanced Debug Utilities
- Improved `debug-auth.ts` for better diagnostic capabilities
- Added an AuthDebugPanel component for visual debugging in development mode
- Fixed import issues with js-cookie

### 3. Improved Authentication Logic
- Added OAuth redirect handling in SignInModal
- Created a client-side only AuthWrapper component to avoid SSR issues
- Enhanced authentication checking to work with HttpOnly cookies
- Created an AuthDebugWrapper to properly handle dynamic imports in Server Components

### 4. Proper Axios Configuration
- Ensured proper withCredentials configuration to send cookies with requests
- Added request/response interceptors for debugging

## How It Works
The new authentication flow works as follows:

1. User authenticates with OAuth provider (Github/Google)
2. Backend sets an HttpOnly JSESSIONID cookie
3. Frontend makes API calls with `withCredentials: true` to include the HttpOnly cookies
4. Backend verifies the cookie and processes the request
5. Frontend tracks authentication state based on API responses, not by checking cookies directly

## Testing
You can use the debug panel (visible in development mode) to test the authentication status and see detailed logs in the console.

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing token refresh mechanisms
- Add expiration handling for long-lived sessions
- Enhance error reporting for auth failures


# Authentication Flow Summary

The following changes have been made to fix cross-domain cookie authentication:

- Updated TokenProvider.tsx to use API calls instead of direct cookie access
- Created AuthDebugPanel.tsx for visual debugging
- Created AuthDebugWrapper.tsx to properly handle client-side components in Server Components
- Enhanced debug-auth.ts utility
- Improved SignInModal.tsx with OAuth redirect handling
- Added proper withCredentials configuration in axios-config.ts
- Created test-auth-complete.sh script for validation
- Fixed Server Component SSR errors with dynamic imports
- Documented changes in AUTH-FIX-SUMMARY.md

These changes ensure that JWT tokens in HttpOnly cookies are properly handled.
