# 🤖 Chatbot Intelligence Enhancements

## Overview
The Itinerarly chatbot has been enhanced with **smart FAQ matching** and **intent recognition** to provide more intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **FAQ Matching** 🔍
The chatbot now intelligently matches user questions to a comprehensive FAQ database:

- **50+ Pre-loaded Questions** across 6 categories
- **Partial Text Matching** (case-insensitive)
- **Tag-based Search** for better accuracy
- **Instant Responses** from the FAQ database

**Example:**
```
User: "Is Itinerarly free?"
Bot: "Yes! Itinerarly is completely free and open-source under the MIT License..."
```

---

### 2. **Intent Recognition** 🧠

#### **Greeting Intent**
Detects: `hi`, `hello`, `hey`, `hola`, `namaste`, `greetings`

**Example:**
```
User: "hi"
Bot: "Hello! 👋 Where would you like to travel today? I can help you plan trips..."
```

---

#### **Trip Planning Intent** 🗺️
Detects: `plan trip to {destination}`

**Example:**
```
User: "plan trip to goa"
Bot: "Sure! Let's start planning your trip to Goa. 🗺️ Click the 'Plan a Trip' button below..."
```

---

#### **Navigation Intent** 🧭
Automatically navigates users to relevant pages:

| User Input | Action |
|------------|--------|
| "take me to map", "show map", "open map" | Navigates to `/start` |
| "about", "learn about" | Navigates to `/#about` |
| "features", "what can you do" | Navigates to `/#features` |

```

---

#### **Destination Recommendation Intent** 🌏
Detects: `where should I go`, `recommend`, `suggest destination`

**Example:**

```

---

#### **Weather Intent** ☀️
Detects: `weather`, `climate`

```

---

#### **Thank You Intent** 🙏
Detects: `thank`

**Example:**
```
User: "thanks"
Bot: "You're welcome! Happy to help make your Indian travel adventure amazing!"
```

---

### 3. **Fallback Message** 🌱
When nothing matches, the bot provides a helpful fallback:

```
"I'm not sure about that yet 🌱 — but I can help you explore destinations or plan trips! 
Try saying 'plan a trip to Goa' or 'show me the map' or ask me any travel question about India! 🇮🇳"
```
