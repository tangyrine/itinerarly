# üõ†Ô∏è OAuth Authentication Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing an error during OAuth authentication:
```
{
  "error": "OAuth2 authentication failed: An invalid character [34] was present in the Cookie value"
}
```

Character [34] is the ASCII code for double quotes ("), which was causing problems in cookie values, particularly in JWT tokens.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cookie Handling
- Improved the `checkAuthenticationMechanisms` function to proactively sanitize cookies
- Added logic to detect and fix malformed JWT tokens in cookies
- Implemented automatic cookie cleaning when OAuth errors are detected

### 2. Added Redirect Logic
- Added logic to redirect to the `/start` page when a user is successfully authenticated
- Implemented special handling for OAuth redirects to ensure smooth authentication flow
- Clean up OAuth-related storage entries after successful authentication

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added specific detection and handling for the OAuth2 invalid character error
- Implemented automatic recovery by cleaning and resubmitting the request when this error occurs
- Enhanced logging to better track authentication issues

## Key Components Updated

1. **TokenProvider.tsx**
   - Enhanced cookie extraction and sanitization
   - Added automatic cookie cleanup
   - Implemented redirect logic to /start page
   - Added specific error handling for OAuth errors

2. **cookie-utils.ts** (existing functionality used)
   - Utilized `extractJwtToken` to clean problematic JWT tokens
   - Used `setCookieSafely` to safely store cookies
   - Leveraged cookie sanitization to handle special characters

## Testing
- Created `test-oauth-cookie-fix.js` to verify JWT token extraction with problematic characters
- Tested handling of quotes, semicolons, and other special characters in cookie values
- Verified redirection logic after successful authentication

## How to Verify
1. Sign in using OAuth (Google or GitHub)
2. Check that authentication succeeds without the character [34] error
3. Verify automatic redirection to the `/start` page after successful authentication
4. Confirm that tokens are available and authenticated API calls work correctly

## OAuth Flow Sequence
1. User clicks sign-in button ‚Üí redirected to OAuth provider
2. After successful provider authentication ‚Üí redirected back with tokens
3. Cookies are sanitized to remove problematic characters
4. User is automatically redirected to `/start` page
5. Authentication state is properly maintained throughout the application
