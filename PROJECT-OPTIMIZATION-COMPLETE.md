## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 🎬 Video Performance Optimization
- **Responsive video loading** with device-specific file selection
- **Delayed loading strategy** (1-2s based on device capability)
- **Optimized video files**: 6 variants (mobile: 3.5MB→2.9MB WebM)
- **Device detection**: Memory, CPU cores, WebM support
- **Static poster fallback** for immediate visual feedback
- **Simplified source structure** for faster loading

### 🖼️ Image Optimization
- **Next.js Image component** implementation with lazy loading
- **Priority loading** for first carousel image
- **Responsive sizing** with proper `sizes` attribute
- **Blur placeholder** for better perceived performance

### 📦 Code Splitting & Loading
- **Dynamic imports** for Footer component
- **Delayed floating elements** (2s delay)
- **Suspense boundaries** for error handling
- **Resource hints** for critical assets

### 🔗 Backend Integration
- **Production backend URL** configured: `https://itinerarly-be.onrender.com`
- **OAuth redirect fixes** in 5+ components
- **Environment variables** properly set for production
- **Fallback handling** for network issues

### 🍪 Cross-Domain Cookie Configuration
- **Global axios configuration**: `axios.defaults.withCredentials = true`
- **Automatic import** in app layout
- **Debug logging** for troubleshooting
- **Backend preconnect** for performance

### 🐳 Docker Security Hardening
- **Updated base image**: `node:20-slim` with security patches
- **Non-root user execution**: `nextjs:1001`
- **Multi-stage build** with proper file ownership
- **Security exclusions** in `.dockerignore`
- **Health check endpoint**: `/api/health`
